This repo contains a set of Terraform modules that can be used to provision an Elastic

Kubernetes (EKS) cluster on AWS.

First, we have to [create](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)[ ](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)[your](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)[ ](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)[AWS](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)[ ](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)[account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)[.](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)[ ](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=gjVJoawn3_fcc7rrNxkhtTCQoJJdCpOB9cNxhXTxpM4&code_challenge_method=SHA-256)We will have to enter the credit card but every

component you will deploy will not incur fees.

Then we also have to **install [AWS**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)[** ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)[CLI**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)[.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)**

After these steps, you can **log in to your account**.

**Step 1: Set up Terraform with AWS**

The first thing to **set up** is **our Terraform**. We will **create an AWS IAM users for Terraform**.

In our **AWS console**, we have gone to the **IAM section** and **created a user named “FullAccess”**.

Then have **added our user to a group** named “FullAccessGroup”. Attaches to this group the

following rights:

• **AdministratorAccess**

• **AmazonEKSClusterPolicy**

After these steps, AWS will provide us with a **Secret Access Key and Access Key ID**. We had

**Saved them preciously** because this was the only time AWS gives it to you.

In our own console, we have created a ~/.aws/credentials file and put your credentials in it:

[default]

aws\_access\_key\_id=\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

aws\_secret\_access\_key=\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The last step is to **create this file**:

[default]

region=eu-west-3

**Step 2: Creation of EC2 instance**

First, we launched an EC2 instance with Amazon Linux AMI inside which we were able to run

some Terraform.

This was done first connecting to the ec2 instance using putty.





\1. First of all, we need to have puttygen and Putty exe for connecting to the server from

Windows (or the SSH command on Linux).

•

We had downloaded putty by following link.

<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>

• Then we went to putty.exe and clicked on ***64 bit.***

• Then we went to puttygen.exe then click on ***64 bit*** to download the tool.

• Then we went to physical location and check the putty and puttygen tools.

• After that, we converted pem file to ppk file by using puttygen by opening puttygen by

typing puttygen on search bar.

• Then we opened puttygen and clicked on ***Load.***

• Then we selected the pem file from physical location and clicked on ***open and then we***

***clicked on OK.***

• Then we saved ppk file with name of linux.

• By following above steps, we can connect to the server with help of ppk file by using

putty.

• Then we went to the instance and copied Public IPV4 address.

• Then we opened the putty by typing putty on search bar

• Then we specified Public IPV4 of our instance which we copied

• Then to setup connection at the left side menu then select “SSH” and then select

“Auth”. We had clicked on the ***browse.***

•

Then we selected ppk file from physical location and clicked on ***open.***

\2. For downloading and installing Terraform we had followed the following steps:

• First, we need to Terraform official website by using the link below.

[https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

• Select Linux 64-bit and copy the link address.

• Then we went inside the Linux Server Terminal.

• Then we downloaded the package using the copied url with wget command.

• After that we saw the terraform zip file which was downloaded.

• Then unzipped the package using **Unzip Terraform package.**

• After that we saw the terraform binary file.





• Then we executed the binary file for installing terraform.

./terraform

• Then we verified the version using the following command:

terraform --version

• After that we set the path by using the following command:

Pwd

echo $"export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)" >> ~/.bash\_profile

source ~/.bash\_profile

Then we started the terraform.

**Step 3. Creation of directories and Terraform**

**files**

Inside the EC2 instance we have created a directory named “AWSEKSCLUSETR”. In that

directory, we have created various terraform files to create the infrastructure and to deploy the

EKS cluster.

The contents of the “AWSEKSCLUSETR” directory are as follows:

\1) alb.tf

\2) eks.tf

\3) kms.tf

\5) kubernetes.tf

\6) outputs.tf

\7) provider.tf

\8) security.tf

\11) variable.tf

\12) vpc.tf

\13) certificate.tf





.

• Among These files first we had created the vpc.tf file.Inside the vpc.tf file we had

defined Public and Private subnet and other details so as to create a vpc network named

“EKS-VPC” which will be used in the creation of our EKS cluster.

• Then we created a kms.tf file which is going to be used in the encryption of da ta.

• Then we created the provider.tf file. This file contains all the information about which

**provider you want to use with Terraform**. We specify here to Terraform that we want

to use an **AWS provider.** As here we are also providing the details of region, access and

secret key.

NOTE: Public and Private subnets that we had created in the vpc.tf are EKS-Public-Subnet

("10.0.3.0/24", "10.0.4.0/24 ") and EKS-Private-Subnet ("10.0.2.0/24 ", "10.0.1.0/24

") and route tables are also created named EKS-VPC with route IDs (“rtb-0476945cbd0ce416b”,”

rtb-07fc5cd2b70595e80")

• Then we created output.tf in this file we have mentioned the name of what values we

want to see when we would perform “terraform apply” such as cluster\_id,

"cluster\_endpoint", "kms\_key\_id", "ksm\_key\_arn" and "loadbalancer\_dnsname".

• Then we created variables.tf file in that file input variables let us customize aspects of

Terraform modules without altering the module's own source code.

• Then we created the security.tf file in which we specified the security groups that

would be needed in the creation of the cluster and in the handling of traffic from the

internet, these security groups are specified for 1) all cluster nodes 2) for node 1

3)for node 2 and 4) for eks public load-balancer.

The Security groups that we created are as follows:

Security group for Kubernetes ELB

EKS cluster security group.

KUBERNETES\_TERRAFORM\_ANSIBLE\_CODE\_SG

NOTE: All other security groups are managed by terraform.

• Then we created a kubernetes.tf file. This file contains “kubernetes” as a provider

because of this file all the dependencies and required permissions will be given at the

time of cluster creation.

• Then we created certificate.tf file in which we defined the configuration to generate a

certificate.

•

After that, we created alb.tf file in which there are target groups for EKS nodes and

listeners for our cluster to connect to the frontend and we have also binded the

certificate with our load balancer by defining certificate\_arn.





• Then we have the eks.tf file in which we have specified the source module, name tag to

give name to the cluster,node groups to specify the worker nodes, vpc id which will

direct to the vpc id module to launch the cluster.

After running the terraform commands then we will have the cluster of the following

configuration and all the files that are mentioned above we wil l provide the source code of it

[**upon request]**

**Configuration**

You can configure your config with the following input variables:

**Name**

**IAM**

The AWS credentials must be associated with a user having at least the following AWS managed

IAM policies

• IAMFullAccess

• AutoScalingFullAccess

• AmazonEKSClusterPolicy

• AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy

• AmazonVPCFullAccess

• AmazonEKSServicePolicy

• AmazonEKS\_CNI\_Policy

• AmazonEC2FullAccess

Most of the IAM policies that are mentioned above will be automatically created with the

kubernetes.tf file.

**Terraform**





You need to run the following commands to create the resources with Terraform:

terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply

TIP: you should save the plan state terraform plan -out eks-state or even better yet, setup

[remote](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html)[ ](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html)[storage](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html)[ ](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html)for Terraform state. You can store state in an [S3](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html)[ ](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html)[backend,](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html)[ ](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html)with locking via

DynamoDB

**Integration of Ansible**

In our EC2 instance inside our “KUBERNETES\_TERRAFORM\_ANSIBLE” directory we have created

the following files so as to connect our main server to the worker nodes of our EKS cluster.

\1) ansible.cfg

\2) ansible.log

\3) AWSEKSCLUSETR

\4) deploy.yaml /**[Playbook.yml created as deploy.yml]**

\5) hosts

\6) pod.yaml

\7) svc.yaml

• We have created a file named “hosts” in the location “/home/ec2-

user/KUBERNETES\_TERRAFORM\_ANSIBLE/hosts” where the Ip address of our EKS

Cluster is stored.

• We have created ansible.cfg file.In the ansible.cg file we have specified the privileges

such as

become = True

become\_method = sudo

become\_user = root

become\_ask\_pass = False





And we have also specified path to inventory file where our host IP of our cluster is

mentioned other than that we have specified the following:

sudo\_user = root

ask\_pass = False

remote\_user = ubuntu

log\_path = /home/ec2-user/KUBERNETES\_TERRAFORM\_ANSIBLE/ansible.log

private\_key\_file = /home/ec2-user/eks-cluster.pem

deprecation\_warnings = False

host\_key\_checking = False

#interpreter\_python = /usr/bin/python3

#ansible\_python\_interpreter = /usr/bin/python3

ansible\_python\_interpreter = "/usr/bin/envpython"

ansible\_connection = local

gather\_facts = True

• Then we created ansible.log where all the logs of the all the activities regarding

pod.yaml,srv.yaml and our playbook.yaml (deploy.yaml) are stored.

• After that we created pod.yaml to specify the pod configuration and we also created

svc.yaml to specify the services inside our worker nodes.

• Then we have created deploy.yaml file which is our playbook where all the automated

ansible code is written in which we have specified the name, hosts and also specified

the tasks to be performed on the worker nodes.

**NOTE:**

**Setup kubectl**

Setup your KUBECONFIG

terraform output kubeconfig > ~/.kube/eks-cluster

export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/eks-clust
